Feralette provided the graphics and I puttogether the site using HTML.<br>&nbsp;<div ALIGN=right><h2><a href="http://www.maxracks.com" TARGET="_blank"><img SRC="max_logo_small.gif" BORDER=0 height=52 width=100 align=RIGHT></a>M@xracksWebsite</h2></div><i>Maxracks</i> hired me to port www.maxracks.com, an e-card site, froma Macintosh to a unix server.&nbsp; It was a complex website, using a 4thDimension database server to log users, store an addressbook for each user,and generate a pict file on the fly that combined an image the user hadchosen with a message from the user, a stamp, and an email address.&nbsp;I recreated the site for unix using <b><font color="#000000">perl</font></b>as the CGI language, and<b><font color="#000000">mSQL</font></b> as thedatabase server.&nbsp; I also reprogrammed their redesigned home page inHTML and javascript.&nbsp; I finished the port in 1999.&nbsp; In 2002,they hired me again to upgrade their site to new versions of the perl GDmodule, and to switch from mSQL to <b><font color="#000000">mySQL</font></b>as the database server.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<h2><a href="treasure/index.html"><img SRC="Sqlogo.gif" BORDER=0 height=93 width=289 align=RIGHT></a>SeaquestGame</h2>I programmed a <b><font color="#000000">shockwave</font></b> game for <i>Flat,Inc</i>, that they developed as part of Addison-Wesley's Knowledge AdventureOnline series.&nbsp; This is a seagoing adventure game... check it out.<br>&nbsp;<h2><img SRC="graphics/hypertv_logo.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=82 width=167 align=LEFT>HyperTVMacintosh Plugin</h2><i>ACTV</i> originally developed their HyperTV internet browser pluginfor Windows.&nbsp; They wanted to support their Macintosh client base aswell, so they hired me to port the plugin.&nbsp; This is a <b><tt><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>C++</font></font></tt></b>module that coordinates a stream of web documents and chat with a videostream.&nbsp; The original was written for windows using VC++.&nbsp; Iported it to Mac OS 8, using Codewarrior and Netscape's plug-in framework,and developed the Mac installer using Installer Vise.&nbsp; I completedwork on this project in August, 2000.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<h2>TenCORE Net Macintosh Development</h2><img SRC="graphics/tclogo.gif" HSPACE=6 VSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=37 width=37 align=LEFT>In1999, as part of a large, telecommuting programming team, I developed someof the Macintosh-specific modules of an ambitious multi-platform web languageproject created in <b>C</b>, called TenCORE Net.&nbsp; This project wascreated and managed by <i>Catharon Multimedia Productions</i>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<div ALIGN=right><h2><img SRC="graphics/esc_logotemp.gif" NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=60 width=102 align=RIGHT>eSchoolActiveX Control&nbsp;</h2></div>In 1998, <i>ACTV</i> asked me to help them work around a problem they werehaving using Java with Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh in their eSchoolproduct.&nbsp; I developed a Macintosh ActiveX control in <b>C</b> forInternet Explorer that allowed them to coordinate video with a timed streamof web documents.<br>&nbsp;<h2><img SRC="graphics/LMAWCD.gif" HSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=169 width=230 align=LEFT>GetSet For Kindergarten</h2>In 1997, I helped <i>The Children's Television Workshop</i> port theirGet Set for Kindergarten series to the Macintosh.&nbsp; I managed the effortsof two of CTW's in-house programmers, designing and implementing a strategyto port their Windows-based <b>C++</b> code to the Mac.&nbsp; The 2 Discseries included&nbsp; Let's Make A Word! and Get Set to Learn!:&nbsp; bothproducts used the same engine.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<div ALIGN=right><h2><img SRC="KD730.jpg" BORDER=0 height=92 width=120 align=RIGHT>Fun WithScience&nbsp;</h2></div>As part-owner and technical designer for <i>Boing!</i>, I designed thetechnical aspects of all of Boing's products.&nbsp; Our biggest effortwas Fun With Science, a 6 CD educational series we developed for <i>VTech</i>and <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>.&nbsp; To complete this product,&nbsp;I led a team of two programmers, creating the script-based game enginefor Windows in <b>C++</b>, in about 9 months.&nbsp; We also use <b>VisualBasic</b> and <b>perl</b> extensively to create the production utilities.&nbsp;I completed this project in July, 1996.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mostsignificantbits.com/msb/24809.asp" TARGET="_blank">Buyit!</a><br>&nbsp;<h2><img SRC="graphics/AFTTS_sm.gif" HSPACE=4 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=142 width=124 align=LEFT>AField Trip to the Sky</h2>In 1996, I completed programming of a complex astronomy CD, <font color="#000000">AField Trip to the Sky</font>.&nbsp; <i>Terra Associates</i> originallyhired me in 1995 to work on the project, which they developed for SunBurstbased on an Apple II product.&nbsp; I programmed the product entirely in<b><font color="#000000">Director</font></b>,except for the lab section.&nbsp; For this section I created an XObjecti<font color="#000000">n <b>C</b> f</font>or both Windows and Macintosh,based on the books <u>Astronomical Algorithms</u> and <u>Elements of SolarEclipses 1951-2000</u>, by Jean Meuss.&nbsp; The functions included: renderinga 3D model of the Earth, Sun, and Moon based on the date;&nbsp; renderinga 3D model of the shadow cast on the Earth and Moon by the sun, dependingon the date; rendering a shadow of a person standing on the earth at agiven date, time and location (including eclipses).&nbsp; <i>Boing! LLC</i>took over the project, completing it in 1996.</td><td VALIGN=TOP><div ALIGN=right><h4>Projects</h4></div><div align=right><tt>Interactive Phonics</tt><br><tt>Maxracks Site</tt><br><tt>Feralette Site</tt><br><tt>Seaquest Game</tt><br><tt>HyperTV Browser Plugin</tt><br><tt>TenCORE</tt><br><tt>Speech Recognition Prototype</tt><br><tt>Read 180</tt><br><tt>eSchool ActiveX Control</tt><br><tt>Numbers and Letters CD</tt><br><tt>Fun With Science</tt><br><tt>A Field Trip to the Sky</tt><br><tt>Brain Builders</tt><br><tt>Thinking Machines</tt><br><tt>Priority Credit Exchange</tt><br><tt>Cosmic Encounter</tt><br><tt>DFi</tt><br><tt>SyncLips</tt><br><tt>CUNY Math Survey</tt><br><tt>IBM's Explore Series</tt><br><tt>StoryBook Theater</tt><br><tt>Explore-a-Story</tt><br><tt>Stage One</tt></div></td></tr></table><br>&nbsp;<center><p><font size=-1>&copy; 2002 xRGB, Inc</font></center></body></html>
