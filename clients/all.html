<h3>Practice and Assessment</h3>
As a software engineer at <strong>Amplify, Inc</strong>, I was responsible for the design and implementation, from inception to version 1.0, of Amplify's <em>Math Practice and Assessment</em> web application.</p>
<p><em>Math Practice and Assessment</em> was created with <a href="../skills/web.html">javascript</a> using AngularJS, and <a href="../skills/java.html">java</a>, along with a <a href="../skills/mysql.html">Postgres</a> database.

<h3>Nook Conversion</h3>
<p><strong>Barnes & Noble</strong> requested a set of prototypes to test the conversion of children's Nook books to web applications.</p>
<p>To accomplish this I investigated multiple flash conversion packages, designed and implemented <a href="../content.html">perl</a> scripts to convert flash animations to html/css, and produced a series of <a href="../web.html">javascript</a>  modules to recreate the book UX.</p>

<h3>Tour Forecast</h3>
<p> <a href="https://www.xrgb.com/tourforecast/" target="_blank"><em>Tour Forecast</em></a> is a web application I created in <a href="../skills/web.html">javascript</a> using AngularJS, with the back end service written in <a href="../skills/web.html">perl</a>.</p>
<p>With it, a user can determine the forecast for a planned road trip, leaving anytime in the next few days. </p>
<p><em>Tour Forecast</em> uses Google's Directions API to determine the route, and NWS's digital product api to determine the forecast.  Try it <a href="https://www.xrgb.com/tourforecast/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<h3>PeopleMap</h3>
    <p>In 2009, <a href="../clients/sc.html">Simulation Curriculum</a> asked me to create <em>PeopleMap</em>, a data-scraping proof-of-concept application. I used <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>, <a href="../skills/web.html">PHP</a>,
    and a <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a> database. The application scrapes person data out of wikipedia, and maps the birthplaces of people within a given date range using the Google Maps API.  </p>

<h3>SRI Math Database</h3>
<p>I developed a database and client for the <strong>SRI Center for Technology in Learning</strong>.  This database contains the content for SRI's development of middle school math materials based on Singapore's highly successful pre-algebra math curriculum.  The database is managed with <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a>, and I wrote the front end in <a href="../skills/scripting.html">Python</a> using wxWidgets. I also developed a series of content management scripts using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">Python</a>.

<h3>Math-O-Matic</h3>
<p><strong>Mullaghdun</strong> asked me to rewrite their successful <em>Math-O-Matic</em> product in order to make it more expandable. I redesigned and rewrote the Director code from the ground up, including a set of libraries I designed that strengthened <strong>Lingo's</strong> object-oriented abilities.  We also developed the code for a new series of math modules dealing with fractions and integers.</p>  
<p>Check out their trial version <a href="http://www.math-o-matic.com/">here</a>.

	<h3>Starry Night Localization</h3>
	<p>In 2005 <strong>Imaginova</strong> approached me about working on their successful astronomy product, <em>Starry Night</em>, and its associated telescope plug-ins.  I upgraded the <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> code to be unicode friendly, as well as updating the user interface to allow for the insertion of variable length text.  To assist in the process, I prepared a series of <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> scripts to extract, log, translate, and reinsert text.  Imaginova released the German version of Starry Night in 2006.</p>

<h3>Interactive Phonics System</h3>
<p><a href="../clients/scholastic.html">Scholastic,
Inc</a> contracted with me to produce a series of phonics projects. The first was the <em>Scholastic Phonics Readers</em>, a 12 CD set of interactive stories and activities. Scholastic provided the assets,
while I provided the technical design and either completed or managed the programming.&nbsp; I developed an engine in <strong>Macromedia Director</strong> which brought together database information and graphic and audio assets to produce a director file for each portion of the program.&nbsp; This approach enabled us to produce a set of 12 CDs, encompassing 72 stories, 216 activities, 72 tests, and a teacher managment section, and using approximately 26,000 assets, in slightly less than a year.&nbsp; </p><p>Another programmer and I also developed the management portion of the product in Director.&nbsp; This included the student login and teacher management section, which used the v12 database xtra to keep track of student activity. </p>
<p> In addition to programming the product itself in Director, I created or managed the creation of several production utilities in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> and Quicktime, Director, Delphi, and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>.</p>
<p><img class="embedded_image_right" alt="Scholastic IPS" src="../graphics/proj_shots/ipbb.png" />Following the Phonics Readers, we developed the <em>Scholastic Phonics Booster Books</em>, an 8 CD set of 36 additional readers and activities. </p>

<h3>M@xracks Website</h3>
<p>In 1999<a href="../clients/maxracks.html">Maxracks</a> hired me to port <em>www.maxracks.com</em>, an e-card site, from a Macintosh to a unix server.&nbsp; It was a complex website, using a 4th Dimension database server to log users, store an addressbook for each user, and generate a pict file on the fly that combined an image the user had chosen with a message from the user, a stamp, and an email address.&nbsp; I recreated the site for unix using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> as the CGI language, and mSQL as the database server.&nbsp; I also reprogrammed their redesigned home page in HTML and javascript.&nbsp; I finished the port in 1999.&nbsp; In 2002, they hired me again to upgrade their site to new versions of the perl GD module, and to switch from mSQLto <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a> as the database server.</p>

<h3>Get Set For Kindergarten</h3>
<p>In 1997, I helped the <strong>Children's Television Workshop</strong> port their <em>Get Set for </em>series to the <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>.  I managed the efforts of two of CTW's in-house programmers, designing and implementing a strategy to port their Windows-based <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> code to the Mac.&nbsp; The 2 Disc series included <em>Let's Make A Word!</em> and <em>Get Set to Learn!</em>.  Both products used the same engine.</p>

<p>As part-owner and technical designer for <a href="../entities/boing.html">Boing!</a>,
I designed the technical aspects of all of Boing's products.&nbsp; Our
biggest effort was <em>Fun With Science</em>, a 6 CD educational series we developed
for <strong>VTech</strong> and <strong>Encyclopedia
Britannica</strong>.&nbsp; To complete this product,&nbsp; I led a team of two
programmers, creating the script-based game engine for Windows in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>,
in about 9 months.&nbsp; We also use Visual Basic and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>
extensively to create the production utilities.&nbsp; I completed this
project in July, 1996.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-VTech-3rd-Grade-Science/dp/B002OELT28" target="_blank">Buy

<h3>A Field Trip to the Sky</h3>
<p>In 1996, I completed programming of a complex astronomy CD, <em>A Field Trip to the Sky</em>.&nbsp; <strong>Terra Associates</strong> originally hired me in 1995 to work on the project, which they developed for SunBurst based on an Apple II product.&nbsp; I programmed the product entirely in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a>, except for the lab section.&nbsp; For this section I created an XObject in <a href="../skills/c.html">C</a> for both Windows and <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>, based on the books <u>Astronomical Algorithms</u> and <u>Elements of Solar Eclipses 1951-2000</u>, by Jean  Meuss.&nbsp; The functions included: rendering a 3D model of the Earth, Sun, and Moon based on the date;&nbsp; rendering a 3D model of the shadow cast on the Earth and Moon by the sun, depending on the date; rendering a shadow of a person standing on the earth at a given date, time and location (including eclipses).&nbsp; <a href="../entities/boing.html">Boing! LLC</a> took over the project, completing it in 1996.&nbsp; <a href="http://sunburst-store.com/cgi-bin/sunburst.storefront/3dbea2c00e6693972717d00b8932072e/Product/View/6696" target="_blank">Buy It!</a></p>
