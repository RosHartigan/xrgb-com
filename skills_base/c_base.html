<h3>C/C++ Experience</h3>
<p>I've been working with <strong>C</strong> for over 25 years, and <strong>C++</strong> for over 15. I've developed applications in C and C++ for  <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>, Windows, and unix platforms, using a variety of development environments.  These projects have ranged from large consumer products to plug-ins and utilities.
