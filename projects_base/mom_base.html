<h3>Math-O-Matic</h3>
<p><strong>Mullaghdun</strong> asked me to rewrite their successful <em>Math-O-Matic</em> product in order to make it more expandable. I redesigned and rewrote the Director code from the ground up, including a set of libraries I designed that strengthened <strong>Lingo's</strong> object-oriented abilities.  We also developed the code for a new series of math modules dealing with fractions and integers.</p>  
<p>Check out their trial version <a href="http://www.math-o-matic.com/">here</a>.
