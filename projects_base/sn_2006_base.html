	<h3>Starry Night Localization</h3>
	<p>In 2005 <strong>Imaginova</strong> approached me about working on their successful astronomy product, <em>Starry Night</em>, and its associated telescope plug-ins.  I upgraded the <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> code to be unicode friendly, as well as updating the user interface to allow for the insertion of variable length text.  To assist in the process, I prepared a series of <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> scripts to extract, log, translate, and reinsert text.  Imaginova released the German version of Starry Night in 2006.</p>
	<p>You can find out more about Starry Night <a href="http://www.starrynight.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
