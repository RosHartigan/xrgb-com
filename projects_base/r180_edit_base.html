<h3>Scholastic Read 180 Edit Tools</h3>
<p>In late 2003, <strong>Grassroots Technologies</strong> came to me on behalf of <a href="../clients/scholastic.html">Scholastic, Inc</a>. In preparation for a new release of <em>Read 180</em>, they asked me to overhaul and make useable a set of production tools written for the <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a> in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>. I was able to give them a working set of tools by early 2004.</p>
<p>I upgraded a set of <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>-based production tools written in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> for Scholastic, Inc.</p>
