<h3>SRI Math Database</h3>
<p>I developed a database and client for the <strong>SRI Center for Technology in Learning</strong>.  This database contains the content for SRI's development of middle school math materials based on Singapore's highly successful pre-algebra math curriculum.  The database is managed with <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a>, and I wrote the front end in <a href="../skills/scripting.html">Python</a> using wxWidgets. I also developed a series of content management scripts using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">Python</a>.
