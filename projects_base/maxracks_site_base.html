<h3>M@xracks Website</h3>
<p>In 1999<a href="../clients/maxracks.html">Maxracks</a> hired me to port <em>www.maxracks.com</em>, an e-card site, from a Macintosh to a unix server.&nbsp; It was a complex website, using a 4th Dimension database server to log users, store an addressbook for each user, and generate a pict file on the fly that combined an image the user had chosen with a message from the user, a stamp, and an email address.&nbsp; I recreated the site for unix using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> as the CGI language, and mSQL as the database server.&nbsp; I also reprogrammed their redesigned home page in HTML and javascript.&nbsp; I finished the port in 1999.&nbsp; In 2002, they hired me again to upgrade their site to new versions of the perl GD module, and to switch from mSQLto <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a> as the database server.</p>
<p>I ported the maxracks website to a unix server, using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> as the CGI language.  At first we used mSQL as the database manager, eventually switching to <a href="../skills/mysql.html">MySQL</a>.</p>
