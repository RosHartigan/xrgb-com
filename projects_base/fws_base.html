<p>As part-owner and technical designer for <a href="../entities/boing.html">Boing!</a>,
I designed the technical aspects of all of Boing's products.&nbsp; Our
biggest effort was <em>Fun With Science</em>, a 6 CD educational series we developed
for <strong>VTech</strong> and <strong>Encyclopedia
Britannica</strong>.&nbsp; To complete this product,&nbsp; I led a team of two
programmers, creating the script-based game engine for Windows in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>,
in about 9 months.&nbsp; We also use Visual Basic and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>
extensively to create the production utilities.&nbsp; I completed this
project in July, 1996.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-VTech-3rd-Grade-Science/dp/B002OELT28" target="_blank">Buy
it!</p></a>
<p>VTech hired my partnership, Boing!, to create this 6-CD educational series. I developed it in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>,
using <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a> to create the production utilities.</p>
