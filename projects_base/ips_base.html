<h3>Interactive Phonics System</h3>
<p>In 2002 I completed a series of projects for <a href="../clients/scholastic.html">Scholastic,
Inc</a>.&nbsp; The first was the <em>Scholastic Phonics Readers</em>, a 12 CD set of interactive stories and activities. Scholastic provided the assets,
while I provided the technical design and either completed or managed the programming.&nbsp; I developed an engine in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a> which brought together database information and graphic and audio assets to produce a director file for each portion of the program.&nbsp; This approach enabled us to produce a set of 12 CDs, encompassing 72 stories, 216 activities, 72 tests, and a teacher managment section, and using approximately 26,000 assets, in slightly less than a year.&nbsp; </p><p>Another programmer and I also developed the management portion of the product in Director.&nbsp; This included the student login and teacher management section, which used the v12 database xtra to keep track of student activity. </p>
<p> In addition to programming the product itself in Director, I created or managed the creation of several production utilities in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> and Quicktime, Director, Delphi, and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>.</p>
<p><img class="embedded_image_right" alt="Scholastic IPS" src="../graphics/proj_shots/ipbb.png" />Following the Phonics Readers, we developed the <em>Scholastic Phonics Booster Books</em>, an 8 CD set of 36 additional readers and activities. </p>
<p>Check out the flash demo of the series on <a href="http://teacher.scholastic.com/ips/discover.htm" target="_blank">Scholastic's site</a>. </p>
<p>Scholastic, Inc. hired me to create a 12-CD set of interactive stories and activities in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a>, along with production tools written in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> and Quicktime, Director, Delphi, and <a href="../skills/scripting.html">perl</a>. </p>
