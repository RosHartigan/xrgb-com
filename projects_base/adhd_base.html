<h3>Sackler Institute ADHD Project</h3>
<p>The <strong>Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology</strong> hired me to develop a series of games in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a> for their ongoing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder project. </p>
<p>These short, fun games were designed to engage, and possibly extend the attention span of, young children considered to be at risk for ADHD. In addition to implementing the game functions, and slowly extending the game wait time, these activities also collected data about response times.</p>
