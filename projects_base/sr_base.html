<h3>Speech Recognition Prototype</h3>
<p>In 1999, <a href="../clients/scholastic.html">Scholastic, Inc.</a> hired me to develop a prototype for a speech recognition product, in which they tested the idea of using speech recognition technology to give students feedback on their reading skills.&nbsp; I created this product for Windows, using <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>, IBM's ViaVoice engine, and Lernout and Hauspie's engine.</p>
