<h3>TenCORE Net Macintosh Development</h3>
<p>In 1999, as part of a large, distributed programming team, I developed some of the <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>-specific modules of an ambitious multi-platform web language project created in <a href="../skills/c.html">C</a>, called <em>TenCORE Net</em>.&nbsp; This project was created and managed by <strong>Catharon
Multimedia Productions</strong>.&nbsp; You can check out the language, now called <em>VDelta</em> at <a href="http://www.vdelta.com/" target="_blank">vdelta.com</a>.</p>
