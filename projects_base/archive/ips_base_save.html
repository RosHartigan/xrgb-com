Scholastic provided the assets, whileI provided the technical design and either completed or managed the programming.&nbsp;I developed an engine in <b>Director</b> which brought together databaseinformation and graphic and audio assets to produce a director file foreach portion of the program.&nbsp; This approach enabled us to producea set of 12 CDs, encompassing 72 stories, 216 activities, 72 tests, anda teacher managment section, and using approximately 26000 assets, in slightlyless than a year.&nbsp;<br>Another programmer and I also developed the management portion of theproduct in Director.&nbsp; This included the student login and teachermanagement section, which used the v12 database xtra to keep track of studentactivity.&nbsp;<br>In addition to programming the product itself in <b>Director</b>, Icreated or managed the creation of several production utilities in <b>C++</b>and<b>Quicktime</b>,<b>Director</b>, Delphi, and <b>perl</b>.<br>Following the <b><i>Phonics Readers,</i></b> we developed the<b><i>ScholasticPhonicsBooster Books,</i></b>an 8 CD set of 36 additional readers and activities.</td></tr></table></center></body></html>
