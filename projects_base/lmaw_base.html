<h3>Get Set For Kindergarten</h3>
<p>In 1997, I helped the <strong>Children's Television Workshop</strong> port their <em>Get Set for </em>series to the <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>.  I managed the efforts of two of CTW's in-house programmers, designing and implementing a strategy to port their Windows-based <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> code to the Mac.&nbsp; The 2 Disc series included <em>Let's Make A Word!</em> and <em>Get Set to Learn!</em>.  Both products used the same engine.</p>
<p>Children's Television Workshop asked me to port their windows product, written in <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a>, to the <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>.</p>
