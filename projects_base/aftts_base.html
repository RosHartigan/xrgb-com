<h3>A Field Trip to the Sky</h3>
<p>In 1996, I completed programming of a complex astronomy CD, <em>A Field Trip to the Sky</em>.&nbsp; <strong>Terra Associates</strong> originally hired me in 1995 to work on the project, which they developed for SunBurst based on an Apple II product.&nbsp; I programmed the product entirely in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a>, except for the lab section.&nbsp; For this section I created an XObject in <a href="../skills/c.html">C</a> for both Windows and <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>, based on the books <u>Astronomical Algorithms</u> and <u>Elements of Solar Eclipses 1951-2000</u>, by Jean  Meuss.&nbsp; The functions included: rendering a 3D model of the Earth, Sun, and Moon based on the date;&nbsp; rendering a 3D model of the shadow cast on the Earth and Moon by the sun, depending on the date; rendering a shadow of a person standing on the earth at a given date, time and location (including eclipses).&nbsp; <a href="../entities/boing.html">Boing! LLC</a> took over the project, completing it in 1996.&nbsp; <a href="http://sunburst-store.com/cgi-bin/sunburst.storefront/3dbea2c00e6693972717d00b8932072e/Product/View/6696" target="_blank">Buy It!</a></p>
<p>A consumer astronomy product, programmed in <a href="../skills/director.html">Director</a>, with plugins programmed in <a href="../skills/c.html">C</a> for Windows and <a href="../skills/mac.html">Macintosh</a>, which I developed for Terra Associates on behalf of Sunburst. </p>
