<h3>HyperTV Macintosh Plugin</h3>
<p><strong>ACTV</strong> originally developed their <em>HyperTV</em> internet browser plugin for Windows.&nbsp; They wanted to support their Macintosh client base as well, so they hired me to port the plugin.&nbsp; This is a <a href="../skills/c.html">C++</a> module that coordinates a stream of web documents and chat with a video stream.&nbsp; The original was written for windows using VC++.&nbsp; I ported it to <a href="../skills/mac.html">Mac</a> OS 8, using Codewarrior and Netscape's plug-in framework, and developed the Mac installer using Installer Vise.&nbsp; I completed work on this project in August, 2000. </p>
