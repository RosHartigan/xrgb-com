Workers from Unite, SEIU, HERE, the Laborers, and the Carpenters stood side by side with college students from Boston, Baltimore, New York, Providence, and New Haven, with leaders from the local Democratic Party, with New Haven Aldermen and New Haven Greens. All together, some five thousand faces appeared upon the New Haven Green and marched, chanting, past the centers of corporate and academic power, announcing the birth of a new solidarity for the &quot;new&quot; labor movement.  We cannot yet gauge the significance of that single event, but it echoes an early moment in the American labor movement. As Nelson Lichtenstein points out in his history of twentieth century American labor, <u><i>State of the Union: A Century of American Labor</i></u> (2003), the 1936 strike against General Motors proved to be a watershed not just for the nascent CIO, but for workers all over the United States. Although the General Motors strike and its subsequent settlement in terms very favorable to the CIO directly affected only a few thousand workers, its symbolic importance reached far beyond those employed by GM. &quot;Indeed,&quot;  writes Lichtenstein, &quot;an enormous sense of self-confidence, democratic participation, even liberation swept through working-class ranks... Across industrial America the GM settlement transformed the expectations of workers and managers alike.&quot;  Now, while it may be premature to make such a decisive statement about the recent settlement of the Yale University strike, a prudent observer might conclude that just as Flint, Michigan was the epicenter of the labor movement's most significant moment in the 1930's, so too New Haven may well prove to be an important source for the fundamental ideological and organizational shifts that seem to be reshaping American labor history. <br><br>The Unions at Yale University and the community participation that they've spawned represents the best of the &quot;new&quot; labor movement; a movement that reaches beyond the workers themselves for new sources of solidarity and power; a movement that has as much to do with local civic life as it does with working conditions on the shop floor. But this new labor movement also makes new demands upon organizers and participants. In particular, new labor, as represented by service sector employee unions like SEIU and HERE, attempts to organize populations not traditionally served by unionization, including new immigrants and low-income service workers. Tied to these new organizational populations are new methods of organization, including especially the attempt to forge coalitions between unions and community groups based upon common material and cultural interests.  It is in this historical context that we announce the formation of <b><i>The New Haven Center for Economic Interpretation</i></b>. <br><br>Ours is a three-fold mission: (1) We intend to produce working-papers concerning the political, social, and economic conditions of the New Haven community; (2) We intend to bring speakers to the city, activists and academics, who can address the specificity of New Haven's political economy, as well as its relation to the national and international economies;    (3) We hope to provide programs in economic literacy directed toward members of the local community, workers, and organizers.   </td></tr></table></td><td VALIGN=TOP>  <table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=185><tr><td>  <IMG SRC="images/strip1.jpg">  </td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></body></html>
